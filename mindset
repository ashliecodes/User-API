/* MINDSET TASK:

1. 
- allows people to share their ideas, opinions and criticisms
- no one gets left out from sharing their opinion
- its good to have different perspectives
- problems can be analysed from differing perspectives

2.
- areas which require creativity are subjective, therefore there is no right or wrong answer
- there shouldn't be a need for the person receiving the feedback to have to take it onboard. 
- similarly, the person giving the feedback shouldn't feel as though their feedback has to be taken onboard

3.
- tension can arise as people may be upset that their feedback was not used/applied to the work in question
- the person receiving the feedback might feel like it isn't their work/ideas anymore if the have to take on everyone's feedback
- everyone has different ideas, so it won't be possible to implement every idea someone has as it may cause conflict

4.
- everyone gets to speak/give their opinion uninterupted 
- be empathetic and kind when giving feedback
- make sure the feedback/opinion is not personal
